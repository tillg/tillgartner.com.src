This is the website of Till Gartner. I'm a simple, guy with simple hobbies:
- My family and kids
- My business (I'm a manager of IT companies)
- Some sport: Skiing, running, swimming, more recently some wave surfing.
- Some programming (yes, even though by now I rather manage IT than coding): Play around with new stuff, Java. Currently playing around with Git and GitHub as a web hosting service.
