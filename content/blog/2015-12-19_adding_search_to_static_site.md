Today I discovered Highcharts: A tool to easily create charts online. It actually lets you create the chart on their website (you litteraly need less than 5 minutes!) and publish it from there.

This is the mileage (or would you say _kilometreage_?) of my Vespa since I bought it:

The only downside seems to be the fact that the service costs money if you want to use it in a professional context. They are on [github](https://github.com/highcharts/highcharts) but the description of the licence actually points you to their [online shop](http://shop.highsoft.com/).
