OK, everytbody does it, even I do it: Static websites. It's fast, it's safe, it does the computing where it belongs (as long as you don't need fancy customization, why should a server thing about what the page looks like at read time?). This very site is ststic (built with [JBake](http://jbake.org/) and hosted on [Github](https://github.com/)). It was fun setting it up, it works great - but I couldn't explain my mother how to use it or how to publish some content on it. And that's what a CMs should be about: It has to be usable in the first place.

Therefore I need anotrher setup. I plan to have a look at some different static web site systems, and set up a list of criteria against which I plan to test the different generators...

<a name="criteria"/>
## Criteria
</a>

* Themes
    * Many
    * Beautiful 
    * Responsive 
- Easy to write
    - Editor with preview
    - Easy handling and referencing of pics
    - Pictures in preview
    - Videos
    - Tables
    - Code with syntax highlighting
	- Automated checking of consistency, i.e. the generated website is correct, complete, the pointers don't point to Nirwana...
- Resize pics for fast delivery
- Easy to create new themes
- Based on other HTML, i.e. Bootstrap themes
* Being able to create an [Accelerated Mobile Page](https://www.ampproject.org/) 
- Extensible architecture 
    - Can add stuff, i.e. Picture resizing process
    - At least a programming language I know a bit - or that I am curious to learn (that basically boils it down to Java and JavaScript)

When scanning the literature (and Github). this is the list of generators rthat I should probably have a look at:

- Jekyll - Done

As a result I should have a closer look at *[Harp JS](https://harpjs.com/)*, *[Metalsmith](http://www.metalsmith.io/)*, *[Hexo](https://hexo.io/)* and *[Wintersmith](http://wintersmith.io/)*.

After quickly reading thru the websites of the above tools I decided to give it a try with *[Metalsmith](http://www.metalsmith.io/)*.

## Editors
</a> 

When you think of a static site generation from a base of Markdown files, it quickly becomes natural to look for a good editor. What we want from our editor:

* Preview Markdown
* Preview including the CSS and other transformations that our site generator uses - to make sure we see the same result as it will be displayed in production
* Preview including images. This might be non trivial since the images might be located on a different path in DEV as in PROD...

Editor we look at

| Editor                                | Markdown / HTML Preview           | Comments                          |
|:------------------                    | :----------------------           | :-------------------------        |
| Visual Code                           | ?                                 | Might have something suitable     |
| Atom                                  |                                   |                                   |
| Brackets                              |                                   |                                   |
| [Caret.io](https://caret.io/)         |                                   |                                   |
| [IA Writer](https://ia.net/writer)    | Claims so...                      |                                   |

... probably some more...
