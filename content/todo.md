Things I plan to do on the website:

- Document what I did so far: The GoDaddy settings, the baking script, the Github/Travis setup for autobaking
- Have category pages, i.e. Recipe, SoftwareWeNeed etc
- Fix the code syntax highlighting feature (doesn't work currently)
- Have my old content from the former [gartnerich.com](http://web.archive.org/web/20131107042444/http://gartnerich.com/) website moved over
- Redo the design. I like a lot the one from [Alex Cinan](http://alexcican.com/) - will copy some ideas
- Have a site map in the footer area
- Make it smart-phone-friendly
- Make pages stored locally for long time (i.e. the bookmarks page)
- Have special templates for some content types, i.e.
    - Sites: Entries that describe location, i.e. restaurants, bars...
    - Recipes
- Have my CV online
- Try improving some SEO and [performance](https://developers.google.com/speed/pagespeed/insights/?url=http%3A%2F%2Ftillgartner.com%2F)
- Add comments. [DISQUS](http://www.wikiwand.com/en/Disqus) looks crappy, may be there is a better solution.
- And have more content of course ;)

# Postponed
- Have TOCs for longer markdown files
    I have postponed this one, since the smart guys are currently working on a TOC extension for the pegdown markdown tool that is used by jBake. For details see [here](https://github.com/sirthias/pegdown/pull/206)
