A log of what I did on my website.

- 14.12.2015: The date & time when site was baked the last time displays in the footer
- 13.12.2015: Have a baking process automatically launched when content is modified and Git-pushed. Look here:
    - [Automatically Update Github Pages with Travis Example](https://github.com/steveklabnik/automatically_update_github_pages_with_travis_example)
- 9.12.2015: Have the content Git'ted (that is the content before it is JBake'd)
- 1.12.2015: Moved my list of bookmarks to [tillgartner.com/bookmarks](/bookmarks.html)
- 1.12.2015: Understanding Markdown was easy thanks to the  [cheat-sheet](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet)
